# Tubulinxyz 

# Comp Proposal

## Project Overview

Development of a comprehensive web platform for structural biology, focusing on tubulin protein analysis with advanced molecular visualization capabilities, graph-based data exploration and computational capabilities in the backend (TBD).

## Technical Scope & Specializations

### Core Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, React with Molstar integration
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), async processing, RESTful APIs
- **Databases:** Neo4j (graph relationships) + PostgreSQL (structured data)
- **Visualization:** Molstar molecular viewer, PDB/mmCIF/cryo-EM support
- **UI/UX:** Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS, Redux state management

### Specialized Scientific Computing
- **Molecular Visualization:** Molstar
- **Bioinformatics Integration:** PDB, UniProt, structural biology databases
- **Database Architecture:** Complex graph relationships for protein interactions
- Per need: **Research Component:** 10-20% computational biology research and analysis

### Infrastructure & Devopsy stuff
- **University Server Deployment:** Institut Curie infrastructure(?) -- i can either deploy myself if you guys get me an account or will have to containerize/package the services s.t. your IT team can deploy it seamlessly.
- **Performance Optimization:** Browser caching, precomputed analyses
- **Load Balancing:** Nginx configuration for concurrent users
- **Monitoring and health checks:** some basic Prometheus/Grafana setup
