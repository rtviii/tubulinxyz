- Tubulin Classification (via hmms)
- ligand registry (figure out if possible) 


# MIP/MAP classification

# The landing page:

After everything else is done:
- purported ligand bindign sites
- mutation hotspots
- annotations 

# The structure page

- annotations registry

# The MSA page

- individual chain structural superposition

<!-- - db lib reader implement -->
- create master alignment models and nodes
- implement the mapping on the links
- makes sure the ligands are stored as unique nodes, no duplication in the profile or DB
- implement entity_id->auth_asym_id backlinking system
- write and test in/del/mut logic  
- PTM logic
- Morisette dataset of PTMs
